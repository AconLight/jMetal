Algorithm NSGA-II
=================
NSGA-II is the most well-known and used multiobjective metaheuristic. It was presented in 2002 in the paper `[DPA02] <https://doi.org/10.1109/4235.996017>`. It is a generational genetic algorithm characterized by adopting a non-dominated sorting ranking scheme and a crowding density based density estimator.
